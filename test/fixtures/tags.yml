# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one: {
    id: 111,
    name: "first tag",
    slug: "tag1"
  }
# column: value
#
two: {
    id: 222,
    name: "second tag",
    slug: "tag2"
  }
#  column: value
